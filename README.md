# Fbol_code
This will be a code to compute bolometric flux with proper treatment of reddening and zero-point uncertainties

A serious work in progress. The old code is here (written in IDL), but I am working to transition this to Python as well as add full MCMC to the template fitting procedure. But Iâ€™m making the IDL version public in the mean time.
